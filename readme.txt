Integrates the Chibipaint applet into Wordpress.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates Chibipaint into Wordpress, which the user can use with any registered and public post type.

This plugin is largely rewritten. Where the old version integrates with the Add Image feature of Wordpress 2.9.2, this version adds the applet right above the text editor when you create or edit a post.

The Chibipaint applet\'s official website can be found at http://www.chibipaint.com

If you have any questions or issues, feel free to post them in Support or the plugin\'s issue tracker: <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/Mifuyne/chibipaint-for-wordpress/issues\">https://bitbucket.org/Mifuyne/chibipaint-for-wordpress/issues</a>. The issue tracker is preferred over Support.

== Installation ==

 

1.  Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.
2.  Activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
3.  Go to Chibipaint > Options to customize the plugin as you see fit
